Since you’ve finished users, the next logical module in your schema is Stalls, because:

Product depends on Stall (each product can belong to a stall).

Order also depends on Stall (stall receives orders).

You already have Role.MAIN_ADMIN and Role.STALL_ADMIN, which can be enforced in stall creation & management.

Recommended Order for Building Modules
